## Overview

Jill with LendingClub has asked us to help her with evaluating models for credit risk by utilizing imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries. Algorithms we used in oversampling was RandomOverSampler and SMOTE. Algorithms we used in undersampling models was ClusterCentroid. After completing these two, we then tried a combination approach and used SMOTTEENN. Once evaluated, we used two different models (BalancedRandomForestClassifer and EasyEnsembleClassifier) to predict the credit risk.
